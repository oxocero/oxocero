I use this GitHub mostly for personal projects, experiments, and things I’m learning.
That includes systems-level programming, embedded work, and tooling.

**interests**
- systems programming & operating systems
- embedded systems & hardware–software interaction
- programming language design & tooling
- computing history and retro tech

You probably won’t find polished products here — mostly small, focused projects
and ideas I wanted to explore properly.

## long-term projects & directions

Below is a non-exhaustive overview of projects I’m working on or planning over the long term.
Many of these are slow, exploratory efforts meant to span years rather than releases and some of them are private for now.

Most of these projects are intentionally exploratory, unfinished, or long-running.
The goal is learning, understanding systems deeply, and building things I’d want to exist — not chasing polish or trends.
